The code follows 42's strict norms:

- Functions must not exceed 25 lines
- Max 5 functions in a .c file
- Cannot stick variable declaration and initialization on the same line
- Max 5 variables per block
- Max 4 parameters per function
- Forbidden keywords: for, do ... while, switch, case, goto
- Only existing C functions exit, open, close, write, read, malloc, free, and the functions of minilibx (libmlx) and math.h are allowed. Although other functions may be used in bonus features. Image export in this project's case used fopen, fwrite & fclose.
